SpreadsheetGUI README

Implementation by Saoud Aldowaish

a README txt file for the SpreadsheetGUI to explain additional features and how to use it.

Other than selecting cells with your mouse I added and extra way to change selection by using the arrow keys to go to adjacent cells from the currently selected cell. 
The main additional feature added to SpreadsheetGUI is the ability to get the dependees or dependents of all the cells in the spreadsheet and save them to a DOT file
by selecting it first then opening the save DOT file menu and choosing either "save all dependees" or "save all dependents". You Also can get  and save the dependees 
or dependents of a specific cell by selecting it first then opening the save DOT file menu and choosing either "save selected cell dependees" or "save selected cell dependents". 
If you copied the text from the DOT file you can use this link https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/ to see the graph.


In terms of how I approached the design I tried my best to keep it as simple as possible. Especially for my extra feature I tried to make the code as easy to read and understand as possible.

On 3/9/2021 setup for PS6 finished.

On 3/18/2021 grid requirements are mostly done and you can use arrows to move to other cells.
On 3/19/2021 an extra feature was added and made comments.
